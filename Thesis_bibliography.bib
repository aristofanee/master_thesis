  abstract = {Line emission from plasmas formed during laser ablation of steel in air at atmospheric pressure has been measured for varying pulse energies and focusing distances. By using a Nd:YAG laser with pulse energies in the range of 25--250 mJ, values of the power density up to 710 GW/cm2 are obtained. The variation of emission intensities with the focusing distance and the pulse energy is related to shielding effects of the plasma produced, which depend on the type of absorption wave obtained at different power densities during the initial formation process. The influence of these effects on the elemental analysis by LIBS is studied by obtaining the precision of nickel content determination in steel samples. At each pulse energy, a focusing position below the sample can be found that produces maximum intensity and higher precision. A limit of detection of 64 ppm of nickel in steel was obtained by focusing the laser beam 12 mm below the sample surface for a 100-mm focal-length lens.},

Although large enhancements are observed for all samples, the magnitude of the enhancement is matrix dependent. Whereas all of the dual-pulse studies used ns laser excitation we see interesting effects when using ps and fs laser excitation for single-pulse LIBS. LIBS spectra of copper using 1.3 ps and 140 fs laser pulses show much lower background signals compared to ns pulse excitation. Also, the atomic emission decays much more rapidly with time. Because of relatively low backgrounds when using ps and fs pulses, non-gated detection of LIBS is shown to be very effective. The plasma dissipates quickly enough using ps and fs laser pulses, that high pulse rates, up to 1,000 Hz, are effective for increasing the LIBS signal, for a given measurement time. Finally, a simple near-collinear dual-pulse fiber-optic LIBS probe is shown to be useful for enhanced LIBS measurements.},

These electrons result from an internal conversion phenomenon between the K, L and M levels, and have energies corresponding to the energy differences between these levels. They can be considered as constituting a spectrum characteristic of each atomic species. This effect has been applied in a number of studies, especially in surface science.},

Most practitioners of ATR spectroscopy use the equation for depth of penetration, d(p), to estimate the path length of the evanescent wave through the sample. However, the effective path length, d(e), of the evanescent wave in an ATR measurement, i.e., the equivalent path length in a transmission measurement that would lead to an absorption band of the same intensity, is a more accurate metric than d(p). In measurements designed to obtain the absorptivity of bands in the spectrum of a strongly absorbing viscous liquid, we have shown that the refractive index used in the expressions for d(e) must be modified to take into account the effect of anomalous dispersion before accurate effective path lengths and band absorptivities can be measured.},

More thorough than previous texts, it exploits new powerful mathematical techniques to develop deeper insights into plasma behavior. After developing the basic plasma equations from first principles, the book explores single particle motion with particular attention to adiabatic invariance. The author then examines types of plasma waves and the issue of Landau damping. Magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium and stability are tackled with emphasis on the topological concepts of magnetic helicity and self-organization. Advanced topics follow, including magnetic reconnection, nonlinear waves, and the Fokker--Planck treatment of collisions. The book concludes by discussing unconventional plasmas such as non-neutral and dusty plasmas. Written for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates, this text emphasizes the fundamental principles that apply across many different contexts.},

  abstract = {In contrast to other inorganic solids, glasses may be permanently compacted by application of pressures of the order of 104 to 105 atmospheres. This effect was studied on two simple oxide glasses (SiO2 and B2O3) and several silicate glasses. The effect of compacting was studied by measuring the densities, dimensions, and x-ray diffraction patterns. A definite threshold pressure is observed in vitreous silica and silicate glasses, under which no effect takes place and above which the collapse takes place readily. Vitreous boric oxide behaves in a different manner, collapsing gradually, starting at the lowest pressures. Vitreous boric oxide exhibits also plastic flow with subsequent strain hardening. X-ray diffraction measurements performed on vitreous silica and boric oxide indicate that the compacting proceeds on the atomic scale, leaving, however, the short-range order of the basic structural units unchanged. The density of compacted glass can be restored to the original value by annealing to sufficiently high temperatures. Activation energy of this process was determined in the case of vitreous boric oxide.},

The plasma was generated by focusing the Nd:YAG laser on the target in air at atmospheric pressure. The dispersed plasma light was detected using a two-dimensional intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. The studied elements were chosen according to their different thermal and physical properties, particularly boiling point, melting point and thermal conductivity. The effect of wavelength on the plasma threshold has been discussed. Laser fluence thresholds in the ultraviolet were larger than those obtained using visible and infrared radiation, while the energy threshold is larger using infrared radiation. Correlations between the plasma threshold of metal targets and the melting point and boiling point at 266, 532 and 1064 nm have been established. The results indicate that thermal effects have an important influence on the ablation behavior of metals at the three wavelengths used.},

The composition for each decorative layer was determined by estimating the contribution of the ceramic layer beneath the examined one to the whole plasma emission. Two types of ancient luster have been considered: red and gold, while the pigments examined include painted decorations of different blue tonalities. The measured elemental composition of the decorative layers resulted partially correlated with the color of the painted surface, measured by a standard UV-VIS spectrometer. In LIBS analyses of bronze samples, a procedure was developed, which improves data repeatability and extends quantitative measurements to minor elemental constituents. Results of the quantitative analyses gave indications about the manufacturing process of the artwork, its actual degree of conservation and the presence of residual surface decorations.},

  abstract = {Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has always been a powerful tool for the identification of organic materials. However, with the development of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, it has become a more popular method for the quantitative analysis of complex mixtures, as well as the investigation of surface and interfacial phenomena. This chapter reviews the basic theory behind FTIR spectroscopy and describes the currently used instrumentation and its application to gas, liquid, bulk and powdered solid samples, and thin films using both transmission and reflectance methods, including specular, diffuse, and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) techniques. The optimization of instrumental parameters, sample handling techniques, signal processing, and data analysis are described. The characteristic vibrational absorption bands used for the identification of key chemical structures as well as methods for quantitative measurement of chemical composition are overviewed. Potential problems often encountered in using the different FTIR techniques in material and chemical species characterization and are also discussed in an effort to help the nonexpert in the field to make the best use of these powerful methods.},

  abstract = {We report on investigations of the spatial variations of contamination, roughness, and index of refraction of classically manufactured polished fused silica surfaces. Therefore, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy was used to probe surface and subsurface impurities via the detection of aluminum. Measurements at different positions on the surface of the cylindrical fused silica windows evidenced an almost contamination-free center region, whereas a relatively large contamination area was found close to the edge. In-depth measurements verify the presence of aluminum atoms in the bulk until a depth of several tens of microns for the edge region. In addition, atomic force microscopic measurements show that the surface roughness is larger in the center region compared to the edge. Further, the index of refraction increases from the center region towards the edge as measured via ellipsometry. The results indicate a nonuniform impact of the grinding, lapping, and polishing tools on the surface. The findings turn out to be of specific interest for different applications, particularly for the realization of large-scale high-performance coatings.},

The education of skilled personnel and specialists in the fields of theoretical and practical optics manufacturing is of essential importance for next-generation technologies. Against this background, this book provides the basis for the education and advanced training of precision and ophthalmic optics technicians, craftsmen, and foremen, and it is an extensive reference work for students, academics, optical designers or shop managers, and production engineers. It not only covers particularly used and applied machines, working materials, testing procedures, and machining steps for classical optics manufacturing, but it also addresses the production and specification of optical glasses as well as unconventional production techniques and novel approaches. Optics Manufacturing: Components and Systems furthermore covers the basics of light propagation and provides an overview on optical materials and components; presents an introduction and explanation of the necessary considerations and procedures for the initial definition of manufacturing tolerances and the relevant industrial standards for optics manufacturing; and addresses the production of micro optics, the assembly of opto-mechanical setups and possible manufacturing errors, and the impact of the resulting inaccuracies. In order to allow fast and clear access to the most essential information, each chapter ends with a short summary of the most important aspects, including an explanation of relevant equations, symbols, and abbreviations. For further reading, extensive lists of references are also provided. Finally, exercises on the covered basic principles of optics, approaches, and techniques of optics manufacturing---including their corresponding detailed solutions---are found in the appendix.},

The measurements were carried out in experimental conditions that enable both accurate modelling of plasma emission and high sensitivity for trace element analysis. Depth-resolved measurements were performed by recording spectra for successive laser pulses applied to the same irradiation sites. Validated via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy for the bulk glass composition, the measurements evidence a surface contamination that originates from polishing during glass manufacturing. The measured penetration depths of the contaminants are discussed in the frame of the underlying mechanisms of surface contamination and related to the changes of the optical properties evidenced by ellipsometric measurements. Demonstrated here for optical glass, the sensitivity-improved calibration-free LIBS approach can be used to quantify contaminations of surfaces in all kind of technological applications.},

Therefore, plasma emission spectra recorded during ultraviolet laser ablation of different glasses are compared to the spectral radiance computed for a plasma in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Using an iterative calculation algorithm, we deduce the relative elemental fractions and the plasma properties from the best agreement between measured and computed spectra. The measurement method is validated in two ways. First, the LIBS measurements are performed on fused silica composed of more than 99.9\% of SiO2. Second, the oxygen fractions measured for heavy flint and barite crown glasses are compared to the values expected from the glass composing oxides. The measured compositions are furthermore compared with those obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It is shown that accurate LIBS analyses require spectra recording with short enough delays between laser pulse and detector gate, when the electron density is larger than 1017cm-3. The results show that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy based on accurate plasma modeling is suitable for elemental analysis of complex materials such as glasses, with an analytical performance comparable or even better than that obtained with standard techniques.},

  abstract = {Numerous experimental investigations clearly established that when soda--lime glass is subjected to sufficiently high axial-stress/pressure, it displays a nonlinear mechanical response and deformation irreversibility (inelasticity). This portion of the material behavior is often neglected in material models for glass which tend to focus on the damage and fracture phenomena of the material. However, material nonlinearity/inelasticity can, in principle, have a profound effect on wave/shock propagation phenomena and processes (e.g. spall fracture). Within the present work, the effect of material nonlinearity and inelastic behavior on the dynamic response (including spallation) of soda--lime glass is studied under symmetric flyer-plate loading conditions using computational methods and tools. Material nonlinearity and deformation irreversibility are modeled in two different ways: (a) as a non-linear elastic material response with no deformation irreversibility; and (b) as a linear-elastic, volumetrically-plastic deformation response. Incorporation of nonlinearity and inelasticity phenomena into a continuum-level material model for soda--lime glass recently developed by the authors revealed that while these phenomena do not measurably affect spall resistance (as measured by a minimum flyer-plate velocity resulting in spallation), they provide beneficial linear-momentum/kinetic energy reduction effects.},

Experimental results indicate that the specific grinding energy generally increases with the softening temperature of the glass, and is an order of magnitude smaller for grinding with diamond wheels than for grinding with silicon carbide wheels. From observations of individual grinding scratches and an analysis of the experimental results, it is concluded that virtually all of the grinding energy is expended by viscous deformation. Material removal occurs by flow into chips with silicon carbide abrasive and by brittle fracture preceded by viscous deformation with diamond abrasive. The specific grinding energy with diamond is much less than with silicon carbide, since a much smaller volume of material undergoes viscous deformation when grinding with diamond.},

Contaminating detected include the major polishing compound components, Al present largely because of the use of Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3} in the final cleaning process, and other metals incorporated during the polishing step or earlier grinding steps. Depth profile data typically showed an exponential decay of contaminant concentration to a depth of 100-200 nm. This depth is consistent with a polishing redeposition layers formed during the chemo-mechanical polishing of fused silica. Peak contaminant levels are typically in the 10-10 pm range, except for Al which often exceeds 1000 ppm.},

It is shown that the controversy with respect to measurement and interpretation of contact angles are due to the fact that some (or all) of the assumptions made in all energetic approaches are violated when contact angles are measured and processed. For a large number of polar and non-polar liquids on different solid surfaces, the liquid--vapor surface tension times cosine of the contact angle, {$\gamma$}lvcos{\texttheta}, is shown to depend only on the liquid--vapor surface tension {$\gamma$}lv, and the solid--vapor surface tension {$\gamma$}sv when the appropriate experimental techniques and procedures are used. Equations which follow these experimental patterns and which allow the determination of solid surface tensions from contact angles are discussed. Universality of these experimental contact angle patterns is illustrated; other reasons which may cause data to deviate from the patterns slightly are discussed. It is found that surface tension component approaches do not reflect physical reality. Assuming the fact that solid surface tension is constant for one and the same solid surface, experimental contact angle patterns are employed to deduce a functional relationship to be used in conjunction with Young's equation for determining solid surface tensions. The explicit form of such a relation is obtained by modifying Berthelot's rule together with experimental data; essentially constant solid surface tension values are obtained, independent of liquid surface tension and molecular structure. A new combining rule is also derived based on an expression similar to one used in molecular theory; such a combining rule should allow a better understanding of the molecular interactions between unlike solid--liquid pairs from like pairs. Existing static contact angles for 34 different types of solid surfaces from Zisman et al. are evaluated in terms of their solid surface tensions using experimental contact angle patterns. A FORTRAN computer program has been implemented to automate these procedures. It is found that literature contact angles do not have to be discarded completely; they can be used to determine solid surface tensions, with caution. The surface tensions for the 34 solid surfaces from Zisman et al. are also reported.},

  abstract = {Low-rate dynamic contact angles of 30 liquids on a FC-725-coated wafer surface were measured by an automated axisymmetric drop shape analysis-profile (ADSA-P). Surprisingly, results indicate that FC-725 behaves differently in some respects from what one would expect for non-polar surfaces: only nine liquids yield essentially constant contact angles whereas the others show slip/stick contact angle behaviour. In the worst case, the contact angle increases from ca 50 to 160{$^\circ$} at essentially constant three-phase contact radius. These angles should be disregarded for the interpretation in terms of surface energetics since there is no guarantee that Young's equation is applicable. If one employs a conventional goniometer-sessile drop technique, such contact angle behaviour cannot be easily seen in all cases. These results indicate that the claim from van Oss et al. [Langmuir 4 (1988) 884] that liquids with the same contact angles do not have the same surface tensions is misleading. If the meaningful contact angles are plotted as the liquid--vapour surface tension times cosine of the contact angle versus the liquid--vapour surface tension, that is, {$\gamma$}lvcos{\texttheta} versus {$\gamma$}lv, a smooth curve emerges. Thus, intermolecular forces (or surface tension components) do not have an additional and independent effect on the contact angles, in good agreement with the results from other studies on non-polar and polar polymers.},

Laser pulses are focused on the surface of pellets. A microplasma is formed in the front of samples. The plasma emission contains information about the elemental composition of the samples. By assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and using several standard cement samples, a calibration curve is prepared for each element. The major and minor elements of cement such as Ca, Si, K, Mg, Al, Na, Ti, Mn and Sr are qualitatively and quantitatively determined. For verification of LTE conditions, plasma parameters such as plasma electron temperature and electron density are computed.

For both cases, it is important to ensure that the ICP conditions (temperature and electron number density) are not effected by the ablated mass. By ensuring that the ICP conditions are constant, changes in spectral emission intensity will be directly related to changes in laser ablation behavior. Mg ionic line to atomic line ratios and excitation temperature were measured to monitor the ICP conditions during laser-ablation sample introduction. The quantity of ablated mass depends on the laser pulse duration and wavelength. The quantity of mass removed per unit energy is larger when ablating with shorter laser wavelengths and pulses. Preferential ablation of constituents from a multicomponent sample was found to depend on the laser beam properties (wavelength and pulse duration). For nanosecond-pulsed lasers, thermal vaporization dominates the ablation process. For picosecond-pulsed lasers, a non-thermal mechanism appears to dominate the ablation process. This work will describe the mass ablation behavior during nanosecond and picosecond laser sampling into the ICP. The behavior of the ICP under mass loading conditions is first established, followed by studies of the ablation behavior at various power densities. A thermal vaporization model is used to explain nanosecond ablation, and a possible non-thermal mechanism is proposed to explain preferential ablation of Zn and Cu from brass samples during picosecond ablation.},

Results were obtained using a laboratory instrument with a Nd:YAG laser at fundamental wavelength of 1064nm, frequency doubled to 532nm with energy of 50mJ/pulse. The data was compared for different concentrations of Sr and Ce dispersed in a CaCO3 (white) and carbon (black) matrix. We have addressed the sampling errors, limits of detection, reproducibility, and accuracy of measurements as they relate to multivariate analysis in pellets that were doped with the different elements at various concentrations. These results demonstrate that LIBS technique is inherently well suited for in situ analysis of nuclear materials in hot cells. Three key advantages are evident: (1) small samples (mg) can be evaluated; (2) nuclear materials can be analyzed with minimal sample preparation; and (3) samples can be remotely analyzed very rapidly (ms-seconds). Our studies also show that the methods can be made quantitative. Very robust multivariate models have been used to provide quantitative measurement and statistical evaluation of complex materials derived from our previous research on wood and soil samples.},

Use of these methods is illustrated with experiments conducted in a helium microwave plasma in nonthermodynamic equilibrium produced by an axial injection torch at atmospheric pressure. The excitation temperature was determined at a variable microwave power and different positions along the flame. The results are discussed in terms of the atomic-state distribution function (ASDF) calculated for the plasma.},

  abstract = {The laser-induced breakdown spark has recently been advanced as a method for real-time, in-situ spectrochemical analysis of gases. Many of these analyses take place in ambient air. To better characterize this source, we have measured the temporal variation of temperature and electron density in an air plasma induced by a CO2 laser operating at 0.5 and 0.8 J/pulse. The electron temperature was measured by the double floating-probe technique (DFP). An excitation temperature for oxygen atoms was determined spectroscopically by Boltzmann plots. Electron density in the plasma was measured from the Stark broadening of the 715.6-nm line of 01. At 0.5 J/pulse, the DFP temperature ranged from 175000 K at 5 {$\mu$}s to less than 10000 K at 25 {$\mu$}s, while the 01 excitation temperature ranged from 19000 K at 1 {$\mu$}s to above 11 000 K at 25 {$\mu$}s. The excitation temperature and electron density agree with values calculated by others from local thermodynamic equilibrium models of an air plasma. While the electron temperature from the DFP method is much higher than the excitation temperature at 5 {$\mu$}s, at times greater than 25 {$\mu$}s the two have converged, implying thermodynamic equilibration between the species.},

Measurements on a large number of samples with widely varying thermal history show that the refractive index is a single-valued function of the density. The increase in refractive index for a given density change is smaller than that calculated by the Lorentz-Lorenz theory; the apparent contribution of the induced polarization to the local electric field is very small. This may be due to a reduction in the ionic polarizabilities that accompany the density increase; alternatively, the Lorentz-Lorenz form of the theory may not be valid in solid materials such as glass. Data of other investigators are shown to agree with the data reported here.},

The influence of laser-beam wavelength on fractionation is not well established; in general, it is believed that fractionation is reduced as the wavelength becomes shorter. This manuscript presents an investigation of fractionation during ablation of NIST glasses and calcite using three UV wavelengths (157 nm, 213 nm and 266 nm). Fractionation can be observed for all wavelengths, depending in each case on the laser-beam irradiance and the number of laser pulses at each sample-surface location. The transparency of the sample influences the amount of sample ablated (removed) at each wavelength, and the extent of fractionation. Pb/Ca and Pb/U ratios are used as examples to demonstrate the degree of fractionation at the different wavelengths.}

The data show non-Newtonian viscous flow in this inorganic oxide glass with the viscosity values below the expected Newtonian value.

A comparison of the viscosity behavior of this glass with the molecular dynamics results in a ''Lennard-Jones'' glass shows a number of points of correspondence and suggests the interpretation of the non-Newtonian behavior as resulting from structural rearrangements in the material. The combined data show that the sustained, steady-state stress asymptotically approaches a maximum at very high strain rates. This limiting stress is interpreted as the actual cohesive strength of the material and is calculated to be 1.4{\texttimes}108N/m2 (20,000 psi) for the glass under study.},

  abstract = {The chemical characteristics and the proposed formation mechanisms of the modified surface layer (called the Beilby layer) on polished fused silica glasses are described. Fused silica glass samples were polished using different slurries, polyurethane pads, and at different rotation rates. The concentration profiles of several key contaminants, such as Ce, K, and H, were measured in the near surface layer of the polished samples using Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS). The penetration of K, originating from KOH used for pH control during polishing, decreased with increase in polishing material removal rate. In contrast, penetration of the Ce and H increased with increase in polishing removal rate. In addition, Ce penetration was largely independent of the other polishing parameters (e.g., particle size distribution and the properties of the polishing pad). The resulting K concentration depth profiles are described using a two-step diffusion process: (1) steady-state moving boundary diffusion (due to material removal during polishing) followed by (2) simple diffusion during ambient postpolishing storage. Using known alkali metal diffusion coefficients in fused silica glass, this diffusion model predicts concentration profiles that are consistent with the measured data at various polishing material removal rates. On the other hand, the observed Ce profiles are inconsistent with diffusion based transport. Rather we propose that Ce penetration is governed by the ratio of Ce--O--Si and Si--O--Si hydrolysis rates; where this ratio increases with interface temperature (which increases with polishing material removal rate) resulting in greater Ce penetration into the Beilby layer. Calculated Ce surface concentrations using this mechanism are in good agreement to the observed change in measured Ce surface concentrations with polishing material removal rate. These new insights into the chemistry of the Beilby layer, combined together with details of the single particle removal function during polishing, are used to develop a more detailed and quantitative picture of the polishing process and the formation of the Beilby layer.},

A spectrum recorded with a large delay between the laser pulse and the observation gate exhibits sharp lines that are exploited for wavelength calibration. A second spectrum is recorded with a shorter delay, when the plasma properties enable the accurate simulation of the plasma emission spectrum. The apparatus response is deduced from the ratio of measured over computed line intensities. The method is of particular interest for laser-induced breakdown experiments in which the calibration measurements are performed via the simple change of the irradiated sample.},

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is an available method to eliminate residual surface defects induced by grinding/lapping to meet final product requirements. In this work, CMP experiments with a low-cost fabric cloth pad were performed to study the effects of four key process factors on the material removal rate (MRR), flatness, and surface finish of polished glass disk substrates, and to explore the feasibility to achieve high machining efficiency, sub-nanometric surface roughness, and micrometric flatness of polished glass disk substrates simultaneously under optimized CMP conditions. The experimental results and analyses reveal that the interaction of pad rotational speed and polish head rotational speed had significant effect on the roughness (Ra), down force, and the interaction of down force and pad rotational speed had significant effects on the flatness, and down force and pad rotational speed had significant effects on the MRR. After compromise and prioritization analyses are performed, a combination of the four variables, which is the combination of 50~g/cm2 for down force, 40~rpm for pad rotational speed, 20~rpm for polish head rotational speed, and 100~ml/min for slurry supply velocity, is obtained to achieve high machining efficiency, sub-nanometric surface roughness and micrometric flatness of polished glass disk substrates simultaneously.},

The first part of this review focuses on the applications of the CF-LIBS method. Quantitative results reported in the literature, obtained in the analysis of various materials and in a wide range of experimental conditions, are summarized, with a special emphasis on the departure from nominal composition values. The second part is a discussion of the simplifying assumptions which lie at the basis of the CF-LIBS algorithm (stoichiometric ablation and complete atomization, thermal equilibrium, homogeneous plasma, thin radiation, detection of all elements). The inspection of the literature suggests that the CF-LIBS method is more accurate in analyzing metallic alloys rather than dielectrics. However, the full exploitation of the method seems to be still far to come, especially for the lack of a complete characterization of the effects of experimental constraints. However, some general directions can be suggested to help the analyst in designing LIBS measurements in a way which is more suited for CF-LIBS analysis.},

Fluence values covered the range between the plasma threshold ({$\sim$}1--2 J cm-2 for most elements) and 16.7 J cm-2. The 581 nm output of an excimer-pumped dye laser was used. Results pointed out a strong dependence of ablation rate on experimental parameters. At high fluence, the ablated material efficiently attenuates the incoming laser radiation (plasma shielding) and reduces the ablation rate. The extent of this shielding effect depend also on the experimental variables (buffer gas, pressure) and sample nature. These studies are useful to determine the amount of ablated material as a function of experimental parameters, to understand the extension of the shielding process and to establish the conditions under which it may be avoided.

  abstract = {The progressively decreasing feature size of the circuit components has tremendously increased the need for the global surface planarization of the various thin film layers that constitute the integrated circuit (IC). Global planarization, being one of the major solutions to meet the demands of the industry, needs to be achieved following the most efficient polishing procedure. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is the planarization method that has been selected by the semiconductor industry today. CMP, an ancient process used for glass polishing, was adopted first as a microelectronic fabrication process by IBM in the 80s for SiO2 polishing. To achieve efficient planarization at miniaturized device dimensions, there is a need for a better understanding of the physics, chemistry and the complex interplay of tribo-mechanical phenomena occurring at the interface of the pad and wafer in presence of the fluid slurry medium. In spite of the fact that CMP research has grown by leaps and bounds, there are some teething problems associated with CMP process such as delamination, microscratches, dishing, erosion, corrosion, inefficient post-CMP clean, etc.; research on which is still developing. The fundamental understanding of the CMP is highly necessary to characterize, optimize and model the process. The CMP process is ready to make a positive impact on 30\% of the US\$ 135 billion global semiconductor market. This paper presents an overview of CMP process in general, the science and mechanism of polishing, different metal and dielectric CMP processes. The impact of consumables on the CMP process, post-CMP cleaning, modeling of different CMP processes as well as the future trends are also discussed.},

This review provides a basic description of the development, challenges, and key technologies associated with CMP. We summarize theoretical CMP models from the perspectives of kinematics, empirical, its mechanism (from the viewpoint of the atomic scale, particle scale, and wafer scale), and its chemical-mechanical synergy. Experimental approaches to the CMP mechanism of material removal and planarization are further discussed from the viewpoint of the particle wear effect, chemical-mechanical synergy, and wafer-pad interfacial interaction.},
