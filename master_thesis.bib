  abstract = {The different physical aspects of glass transitions are reviewed and models aiming at their explanation are described. The following three main aspects are distinguished: the degree of stability of supercooled liquids with respect to crystallisation; the variation of physical properties of supercooled liquids in metastable equilibrium above the glass transition; the arrest of structural relaxation at the glass transition. The physical significance of computer simulations of glass transitions in simple liquids and the question of a hidden phase transition underlying an observed glass transition are examined critically. In relation to the stability problem, the geometrical constraints operative in typical disordered structures, such as random sphere packings and random covalent networks, are also discussed. A general survey of glass transition phenomena and concepts is presented in an introductory section.},
