  abstract = {Glass-to-glass transitions are useful for us to understand the glass nature, but it remains difficult to tune the metallic glass into significantly different glass states. Here, we have demonstrated that the high-entropy can enhance the degree of disorder in an equiatomic high-entropy metallic glass NbNiZrTiCo and elevate it to a high-energy glass state. An unusual glass-to-glass phase transition is discovered during heating with an enormous heat release even larger than that of the following crystallization at higher temperatures. Dramatic atomic rearrangement with a short- and medium-range ordering is revealed by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction analyses. This glass-to-glass transition leads to a significant improvement in the modulus, hardness, and thermal stability, all of which could promote their applications. Based on the proposed high-entropy effect, two high-entropy metallic glasses are developed and they show similar glass-to-glass transitions. These findings uncover a high-entropy effect in metallic glasses and create a pathway for tuning the glass states and properties.},

  abstract = {The strengths of certain window glass types, window glass constructions, and window glass treatments are poorly understood by the window-glass-design community. Many assumptions are employed in defining the design strengths of various window-glass types, constructions, and treatments such as laminated glass, heat-strengthened glass, and insulating glass. As part of its ongoing research program into the strength of window glass, the Glass Research and Testing Laboratory at Texas Tech University conducted strength tests on fully tempered monolithic glass lites, heat-strengthened monolithic glass lites, fully tempered laminated-glass units, and heat-strengthened laminated glass-units. The objective of these tests was to determine the strengths of these glass types and constructions relative to monolithic annealed glass lites with the same nominal dimensions. The failure strength data resulting from these tests differ significantly compared to the assumptions underlying design strengths proposed by ASTM for these glass types and constructions.},
